# Homework Assignments for CSCI-6651
## Written by Brandon Frostbourne for Prof. Pillar III

### Scope of work

This repository is designed to be a collection of homework and assignments for the Spring 2022 CSCI-6651 class at University of New Haven wrapped in a larger application.  The goal is to provide a single interface that the user or professor can use to utilize, check, and test each assignment that is dynamically loaded (and reloadable).

### Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- External libraries included in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

### Summary of Files

- [Main executable file](homework-csci-6651.py)
- [Core data structure](core/)
- [Assignment files](core/assignments)

### Additional Remarks

I am creating this repository so that I can not only keep better track of my own code, how often I update it, and further my understanding of Python, but also to keep a record of the interrogatives of my code for the class (who/what/where/how/when/why).  I can look back at what I've done and try to better understand any challenges I'm facing and how I've overcome them.  Similarly, this repository will be used as part of my codebase portfolio for future employment opportunities.

### About Me

My name is Brandon Frostbourne.  With 12 years of IT Systems Administration experience I'm moving laterally into the Digital Forensics field by way of a Master of Science degree in Cybersecurity.  My goal is to work in Digital Forensics Analysis and Investigation to help the fight against the CSAM problemspace.  I'm currently volunteering as a developer and tool validation expert with [ProjectVIC](https://projectvic.org).

In my free time, I enjoy learning about everything Space related, the concepts behind Quantum Theory, and spending time with my better half exploring digital landscapes.
